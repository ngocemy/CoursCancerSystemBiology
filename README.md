In this project, we are interested in the application of the recent clustering method "**Reference Component Analysis**" on a breast cancer scRNA-seq dataset. 

Breast cancer is comprised of multiple molecular subtypes that are defined based on the expression of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors, as well as HER2 receptors. In their work, Chung et al (2017) obtained scRNA-sequencing data from 549 cells from 11 breast cancers patients with different molecular subtypes. Our aim is to assess the performance of RCA on this new dataset and compare our results to the findings obtained by Chung et al. We were particular interested in exploring the tumor heterogeneity in different breast cancer molecular subtypes.
